Confirmatory Factor Analysis (2023 Edition)
===============

Instructor: Shawn Bauldry

Lectures: Pre-recorded and uploaded

# Purpose

This course provides an introduction to Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). CFA is a useful tool for XXX. We will focus on intuition, process, interpretation, and code to fit CFA models in R and Stata. This course is based on my book, co-authored with J. Micah Roos, <[Confirmatory Factor Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Confirmatory-Analysis-Quantitative-Applications-Sciences/dp/1544375131/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=confirmatory+factor+analysis&qid=1673301156&sprefix=confirmatory+%2Caps%2C82&sr=8-3)>.

# Calendar & Topical Outline

There are 11 videos of instruction. Links to lecture recordings will appear in this table. Problem sets and solutions accompany each of the substantive units.
